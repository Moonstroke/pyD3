# pyD3

> Python ID3 tags manager

My work is mainly based on [`id3-py`](http://id3-py.sourceforge.net/), which seems to have been discontinued for a looooong while now.

The repo consists in a module that provides a front-end `Track` class that can manipulate `.mp3` files.  
A command-line tool might follow, one day.

Let me now if you find any errors, or if you have any suggestions!
